Estimation of a random process with an FIR filter.

<strong>Part 1: </strong>Pencil and paper. Consider the following system:




d[n]

s[n]                                           r[n]                            s_hat[n]

Ã…




We wish to design a filter h[n] to estimate s[n] from r[n] such that s_hat[n] is an MMSE estimate.

Assume that s[n] is an i.i.d processes which takes value +/-1 with equal probability for each sample. d[n] is a white, Gaussian noise process with variance s<sup>2 </sup>. c[n] is an FIR filter with impulse response of [1 .2 .4].

Find an expression for R<sub>sr</sub>[n] and R<sub>rr</sub>[n]. R<sub>sr</sub>[n] is the cross-correlation of the observations R[n] an R<sub>rr</sub>[n] is the auto-correlation of the observations.

Set up and solve the normal equations (9.55 or 11.11 from the MIT notes) for N = 4. (Note that N is the length of the FIR filter h[n], not c[n]

MMSE estimation: Simulate the system for filters of length N = 4, 6 and 10. Report the MSE of your results in a table.
